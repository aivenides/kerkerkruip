[ This belongs in Actions, but it has to be defined before the Glimmr and Windows extensions. We should move this somewhere sensible later, and maybe use it for all the options? ]
An option is a kind of value.
The information panels are an option.



Section - Graphics and Windows

[ Disable the status line purely to prevent reverse mode from being switched on. This doesn't prevent us from opening the status line manually, which we already had to do. ]
Use no status line.

[ Testing with Glimmr installed will be slower, due to compilation and graphics, so commits to story.ni would generally best be made with it commented out. It is not necessary to comment out Flexible Windows when Glimmr is commented in. ]

Include version 15/160609 of Flexible Windows by Jon Ingold.
Include Hyperlinks by Kerkerkruip.


[Let's give a custom error message when players attempt 'map' without Glimmr. Useful as long as Glimmr doesn't work, we can delete if afterwards.]

Showing the map is an action out of world. Understand "map" and "show the/-- map" and "m" as showing the map.

Carry out showing the map:
	say "Unfortunately, the graphical map cannot be shown in this beta version of Kerkerkruip. Sorry!".

		Now Banquet is current-test-dream;
	otherwise:
		now Banquet is not current-test-dream;]

[Dream of Tungausy Shaman is current-test-dream.]


[Section - Flexible Windows relisting

[Kerkerkruip's when play begin rules don't fire until after the menu is cleared. This means that extension such as Flexible Windows that have critical startup code in when play begins need to be adjusted. Due to weaknesses in Inform's extension interactions, this has to be in story.ni rather than the Kerkerkruip Glimmr Additions extension.]

The allocate rocks rule is not listed in the when play begins rules. The allocate rocks rule is listed before the show the title screen rule in the startup rules.
The initial hyperlink request rule is not listed in the when play begins rules. The initial hyperlink request rule is listed before the show the title screen rule in the startup rules.

Section - Relist rock validation rule (not for release)

The rock validation rule is not listed in the when play begins rules. The rock validation rule is listed before the show the title screen rule in the startup rules.]



Section - Defining perform syntax (for use without Glimmr Canvas Animation by Erik Temple)

To say perform/@ (ph - phrase): (- if (0==0) {ph} -).



Section - Plurality fix

[Let's see whether this works.]

To decide whether (item - an object) acts plural: 
	if the item is plural-named:
		yes;
	no.




Chapter - Questions fixes

[This needs a lot of tweaks!]

Section - Rules for menu questions (in place of Section 3 - Rules for menu questions in Questions by Michael Callaghan)

Menu question rules is a rulebook.

The menu question rules have outcomes exit (success), retry (failure), menu (failure) and parse (failure).

The first menu question rule (this is the invalid menu reply rule):
	if the player's command matches "help" or the player's command matches "menu" or the player's command matches "hint" or the player's command matches "info":
		if closed question mode is true and menu question mode is true:
			menu;		 
	if the player's command does not match "[number]":
		if closed question mode is true:
			retry;
		if closed question mode is false:
			parse;
	if the number understood is less than 1:
		retry;
	if the number understood is greater than the number of entries in the current question menu:
		retry.

The last menu question rule (this is the default menu question rule):
	exit.

	
Section - Questions fix (in place of Section 4 - Processing menu questions in Questions by Michael Callaghan)

[We need to end the turn after a menu, otherwise no rules run.]

Repeat-question is a truth state that varies. Repeat-question is false.

After reading a command when menu question mode is true:
	follow the menu question rules;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the menu outcome:	
		now repeat-question is true;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the exit outcome:
		deactivate menu question mode;
		follow the every turn rules;
		follow the advance time rule;
		change the text of the player's command to "dontparse";
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the retry outcome:
		reject the player's command;
	if the outcome of the rulebook is the parse outcome:
		deactivate menu question mode.
		
Dontparsing is an action applying to nothing. Understand "dontparse" as dontparsing.

Carry out dontparsing:
	do nothing instead.

[Section - Another Questions fix (in place of Section 4 - Phrase used to ask questions in closed mode in Questions by Michael Callaghan)

The saved question prompt is text that varies.

To ask a closed question, in number mode, in menu mode, in yes/no mode, in gender mode or in text mode:
	now closed question mode is true;
	now saved prompt is the command prompt;
	if in number mode:
		now the command prompt is the closed number prompt;
		now number question mode is true;
	if in menu mode:
		now the command prompt is the closed menu prompt;
		now menu question mode is true;
	if in yes/no mode:
		now the command prompt is the closed yes/no prompt;
		now yes/no question mode is true;
	if in gender mode:
		now the command prompt is the closed gender prompt;
		now gender question mode is true;
	if in text mode: 
		now the command prompt is the closed text prompt;
		now text question mode is true;
	if current question is not "":
		say "[current question][line break]";
	now saved question prompt is the command prompt;
	if in menu mode:
		repeat with counter running from 1 to the number of entries in the current question menu:
			say "[counter] - [entry counter of the current question menu][line break]".]

The saved question prompt is text that varies. [TODO - remove when above has been fixed.]




	
Section - Numbered Disambiguation Fix

[Not sure if this is necessary, but it won't do any harm!]
[TODO: Check if this is still necessary or appropriate with version 7 of Numbered Disambiguation Choices. Note that the documentation for the extension suggests this:

If you want to change this so numbers can only be used immediately after a disambiguation question is asked, add the following to your code:

	Every turn: follow the Numbered Disambiguation Choices reset disambiguables rule.
]

Definition: an object (called item) is still-disambiguable if disambiguation ID of item > 0.

Before looking or taking inventory (this is the reset disambiguation IDs rule):
	repeat with item running through still-disambiguable things:
		now disambiguation ID of item is 0.

Section - Auto-transcript while testing (not for release)

Last when play begins (this is the switch story transcript on rule):
	if text capturing is active or automated fight test is true, make no decision;
	try switching the story transcript on;
	say "Current level: [difficulty level difficulty] ([difficulty])[paragraph break]";
	try asking status;
	try taking inventory;
