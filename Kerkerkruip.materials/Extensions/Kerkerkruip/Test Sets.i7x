	assert "Malygris should be awake" based on whether or not Malygris is not asleep;
	assert that the concentration of Malygris is 2 with label "concentration of Malygris";
	assert "the player should be just-woken" based on whether or not the player is just-woken;
	rule succeeds.

Initial scheduling of Malygris-missing-sleeper:
	now the health of the player is 1000;
	now the defence of the player is 50;
	now the melee of Malygris is 0;

regular scheduling of Malygris-missing-sleeper: compel the action of waiting as a reaction to Malygris.

testing effects of malygris-missing-sleeper: if we assert result "defender was asleep<^\n>+Malygris does not overcome your defence rating", rule succeeds.
testing effects of still-sleepy: if the player is just-woken, rule succeeds.

initial scheduling of Malygris-hitting-sleeper: now the melee of Malygris is 100.
regular scheduling of Malygris-hitting-sleeper: compel the action of waiting as a reaction to Malygris.
testing effects of Malygris-hitting-sleeper: if we assert result "Malygris deals<^\n>+ \+ 2 \(defender was asleep\)", rule succeeds.
testing effects of slapped-awake: if the player is not just-woken, rule succeeds.

Table of Outcomes (continued)
outcome	likelihood	minimum attempts	maximum attempts	antecedent
healer-not-healing-player	20	20	--	--
healer-healing-defender	1	0	20	--
healer-still-injured	1	1	--	healer-healing-defender
healer-healing-self	1	0	20	--

Initial scheduling of healer-not-healing-player:
	prepare a test battle with the healer of Aite, inviting groups;
	Repeat with guy running through people in the location:
		now guy is not asleep;
		now the defence of guy is 50;
		now the melee of guy is 0;
		now the health of guy is the permanent health of guy;
	decrease the health of the player by 3;

regular scheduling of the scheduled event: [does not apply to dependents]
	if the scheduled event is at least healer-not-healing-player and the scheduled event is at most healer-healing-self:
		wait for the healer of Aite to act freely.

testing effects of healer-not-healing-player: if the injury of the player is at least 3, rule succeeds.

Initial scheduling of healer-healing-defender:
	decrease the health of the healer of aite by 3;
	decrease the health of the defender of aite by 4;

testing effects of healer-healing-defender: if the injury of defender of Aite is less than 4, rule succeeds.
testing effects of healer-still-injured: if the injury of healer of Aite is at least 3, rule succeeds.
testing effects of healer-healing-self: if the injury of healer of Aite is less than 3, rule succeeds.

Section - Hiding Penalites Simple Test

Table of Outcomes (continued)
outcome	likelihood	minimum attempts	antecedent
bodmall-sneaking	1	1	--
anchored-to-malygris	1	1	bodmall-sneaking
malygris-robbing	1	1	--
still-with-beacon	1	1	malygris-robbing
still-with-malygris	1	1	malygris-robbing
still-with-bodmall	1	1	malygris-robbing
not-teleported	1	1	malygris-robbing

scenario for simple tests:	
	now bodmall is testobject.

the floor-item is an object that varies.

Initial scheduling of bodmall-sneaking:
	now the teleportation beacon is in the location of Malygris;
	now the dimensional anchor is in the location of Malygris;
	now teleportation-beacon-on is true;
	now the floor-item is a random teleportation grenade;
	extract the player to the location of Bodmall;
	force the fuligin cloak to work;

regular scheduling of bodmall-sneaking:
	now the floor-item is in the location;
	compel the action of throwing the floor-item.

Testing effects of bodmall-sneaking:
	assert result "first taking the teleportation grenade";
	assert result "Malygris, perhaps the greatest of all living sorcerers, is standing here";
	assert absence of result "picking stuff up";
	rule succeeds.

Testing effects of anchored-to-malygris:
	repeat with guy running through people in the location:
		assert "teleportation should be impossible for [guy]" based on whether or not teleportation is impossible for guy;
	rule succeeds.

regular scheduling of malygris-robbing:
	force the fuligin cloak to work;
	now the floor-item is in the location;
	compel the action of throwing the floor-item;

[if the player teleports away but reappears in the same room, their hiding penalty will be wiped out. This could be considered a bug, but I don't think it's worth fixing. Anyway, we can avoid it for testing purposes by using the dimensional anchor.]

Testing effects of malygris-robbing: if we assert result "picking stuff up", rule succeeds.
testing effects of still-with-beacon: if we assert that the location of the teleportation beacon is the location, rule succeeds.
testing effects of still-with-malygris: if we assert that the location of malygris is the location, rule succeeds.
testing effects of still-with-bodmall: if we assert that the location of Bodmall is the location, rule succeeds.
testing effects of not-teleported: if we assert result "Something has stopped you from teleporting", rule succeeds.

Test Sets ends here.
