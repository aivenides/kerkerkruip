Kerkerkruip Dreams by Victor Gijsbers begins here.

Use authorial modesty.

Section - The dream kind

A dream is a kind of object. A dream can be dreamt or undreamt. A dream is usually undreamt. [Dreamt once dream.]
A dream can be redreamable. A dream is usually not redreamable. [Redreamable dreams can be dreamt more than once.]

The considered dream is a dream that varies.

The dreamability rules are a rulebook.

To decide whether (potential dream - a dream) is dreamable:
	now the considered dream is potential dream;
	follow the dreamability rules;
	if rule failed:
		decide no;
	decide yes.

First dreamability rule (this is the unredreamable rule):
	if the considered dream is dreamt and the considered dream is not redreamable:
		rule fails.

A dream has a rule called the start the dream rule.
	
Section - What is Real, What is a Dream

Dreamer-location is a room that varies.
Dreamer is a person that varies.

Dreaming is a truth state that varies. Dreaming is false.

To decide which person is the/-- true body of (guy - a person):
	if guy is the player and dreaming is true:
		decide on the dreamer;
	decide on guy;

["conscious in this world" determines whether someone is capable of fighting and potentially moving around. In fact, it is referenced from the "mobile" adjective. While the player is dreaming, all sleeping people are capable of fighting. This includes the player most importantly.

The "in this world" part indicates two things: One, that the person is worldsharer, but also that "this world" is a world where people sleep. As the rules are now, nobody sleeps in any dream world, although we can change that by adding more details to this phrase.]

To decide whether (guy - a person) is conscious in this world:
	if guy is not alive, no;
	unless guy and the player share a world, no;
	if dreaming is true, yes;
	if guy is asleep, no;
	yes.
	
["sleeping in this world" works similarly. Both phrases will return false if the guy is dead or not sharing a world with the player.]

To decide whether (guy - a person) is sleeping in this world:
	if guy is conscious in this world, no;
	if guy is not alive, no;
	if guy is asleep, yes;
	no.

Section - Starting dreams

	extract the player from combat;
	blank out the whole of the Table of Candidate Dreams;

		if item is dreamable:
			choose a blank row in Table of Candidate Dreams;
			now candidate dream entry is item;
	if number of filled rows in Table of Candidate Dreams is 0:
		say "You sleep a dreamless sleep.";
	otherwise:
		sort Table of Candidate Dreams in random order;
		choose row 1 in Table of Candidate Dreams;
		dream Candidate dream entry.

To dream (item - a dream):
	now dreaming is true;
	now item is dreamt;
	now dreamer-location is the location;
	now the dreamer is the player;
	say "You are pulled towards a dream ...";
	wait for any key;
	clear the screen;
	follow start the dream rule of item.
			
To wake the player up:
	wait for any key;
	clear the screen;
	repeat with guy running through asleep people in the location: [should this be dreamer-location?]
		if a random chance of 1 in 4 succeeds:
			now guy is not asleep;
	now dreaming is false;
	now the player is the dreamer;
	now the player is not asleep;
	now main actor is the player;
	extract the player from combat;
	if the player is not in dreamer-location:
		move the player to dreamer-location;
	otherwise:
		try looking;
	update the combat status; [this might be the wrong place, but I think it's needed]
	now the take no time boolean is false.
