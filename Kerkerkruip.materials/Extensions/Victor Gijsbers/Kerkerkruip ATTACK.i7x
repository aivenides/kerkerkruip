Section - Default texts

[ The author may want to change these texts, so they are collected here in one section. ]

[ Change these if you indicate in some other way how the player is acting, or if the Act/React cycle doesn't make sense for your situation. ]
The peaceful prompt is a text variable. The peaceful prompt is ">".
The action prompt is a text variable. The action prompt is "Act>".
The reaction prompt is a text variable. The reaction prompt is "React>".

Section - I6 variables

The meta flag is a truth state variable. The meta flag variable translates into I6 as "meta".
[The yourself text is a text variable. The yourself text variable translates into I6 as "YOURSELF__TX".]

[ Normally you can't set a person variable to no one, but you can like this! ]
The stand in for no one is a person variable. The stand in for no one variable translates into I6 as "nothing".

Section - Referring to the player

[ See manual section 2.1.3 ]

[ When we talk about the player in combat events, we do not want to say "yourself". ]
[When play begins (this is the change the yourself text rule):
	now the yourself text is "you".]

[ TODO: put back yourself where it is needed! ]

[UGLY. Can we do this better??]
[Does this automatically override the Standard Rules?]

The print protagonist internal rule translates into I6 as
	"PRINT_PROTAGONIST_INTERNAL_R" with
	"[We]" (A),
	"[us]" (B),
	"[our] former self" (C).

Book - States

Section - Life and death

[ See manual section 2.2.2 ]

[ Many rules depend on whether someone is alive or not. You may not need a full health system, but it's easier just to put it all here. Ignore if you like. ]
A person has a number called health. The health of a person is usually 10.

[ Once health drops to zero, you are dead. This holds true for both the player and his enemies. ]
Definition: A person is alive rather than dead if its health is greater than 0.

[ This printing dead property is used to ensure that statements like "You were killed by the ogre" won't be broken if the ogre died at the same time. ]
The printing dead property is a truth state variable. The printing dead property is true.

To say no dead property (deprecated):
	now the printing dead property is false.

To say dead property (deprecated):
	now the printing dead property is true.
	
To say the name of (P - a person):
	now the printing dead property is false;
	say the P;
	now the printing dead property is true;
	
To say The name of (P - a person):
	now the printing dead property is false;
	say The P;
	now the printing dead property is true;

To say the names of (L - a list of people):
	now the printing dead property is false;
	say L with definite articles;
	now the printing dead property is true;

Understand "body/bodies" as a person.
Understand "body/bodies of" as a person.
Understand "dead/killed/corpse" as a person when the item described is dead.
Understand "alive/live/living" as a person when the item described is alive.
[Understand "[something related by equality]'s" as a person.] [Doesn't work, unfortunately.]

Section - Factions

[ See manual section 2.2.4 ]

[ Everyone should belong to a faction. You can add as many factions as you like! ]
Faction is a kind of value. The factions are friendly, passive and hostile.
The specification of a faction is "Factions are groups of people who are allied to each other, and may or may not be opposed to the other factions."

[ Now we define a relation between factions which indicates whether these factions will attack each other. ]
Hating relates various factions to various factions.
The verb to hate (he hates, they hate, he hated, it is hated, he is hating) implies the hating relation.

[ The opposing relationship makes it easier to see if two people are antagonists. ]
Opposing relates a person (called X) to a person (called Y) when the faction of X hates the faction of Y.
The verb to oppose (he opposes, they oppose, he opposed, it is opposed, he is opposing) implies the opposing relation.

The opposition test subject is a person that varies.
Definition: a person is opposer if it opposes opposition test subject. 

Friendly hates hostile. Hostile hates friendly.

A person has a faction. A person is usually passive.
The player is friendly.

[ We need a rulebook to decide whether people are going to battle each other in the current location. If not, we're not going to run all our ATTACK-machinery. ]
The hate rules are a rulebook.	

[ Depreciated - check the combat status instead ]
To decide whether hate is present (deprecated):
	follow the hate rules;
	if rule succeeded:
		decide yes;
	otherwise:
		decide no.

Last hate rule (this is the standard hate rule):
	[ This is for speed. It is the most common case where we decide yes. ]
	if the player is a friendly alive person and friendly hates hostile and at least one hostile alive person is enclosed by the location:
		rule succeeds;
	repeat with X running through alive not passive persons enclosed by the location:
		repeat with Y running through alive persons enclosed by the location:
			if X opposes Y:
				rule succeeds;
	rule fails.

Section - Personal combat state

[ See manual section 2.3.1 ]

[ A person has one of three combat states: Inactive, Act and React.

Inactive: not doing anything in the current round.
Act: the one whose turn it is.
React: this person will be called on to react to the current action. ]

Combat state is a kind of value. The combat states are at-Inactive, at-Act and at-React.
The specification of a combat state is "Represents the state of a person in the current combat round. at-Inactive people are no involved, the at-Act person is the main actor, and the at-React person(s) are reacting to the main actor."

A person has a combat state. The combat state of a person is usually at-Inactive.

Section - Combat status

A combat round state is a kind of value. The combat round states are peace, combat, player choosing, reactions, concluding.
The specification of a combat round state is "Represents the state of the current combat round. This value kind is stored by the combat status global variable, which determines what happens when the combat round rulebook is run."

To update the combat status:
	follow the hate rules;
	if rule succeeded:
		now the combat status is combat;
	otherwise:
		now the combat status is peace;



Book - The combat round

The combat status is a combat round state variable. The combat status is peace.

[ The main actor is the person with the highest initiative, or the player if not engaged in combat. ]
The main actor is a person that varies.

The main actor's action is a stored action variable.

The player did something is a truth state variable.

[ The list of current participants, and a phrase to shift the next one. ]
The participants list is a list of people that varies.

To decide which person is the next participant:
	let P be entry 1 of the participants list;
	remove entry 1 from the participants list;
	decide on P;



Chapter - The combat round rules

The combat round rules is a rulebook.

The starting the combat round rules are a rulebook.

Section - Altering the turn sequence rules

[ We replace the beginning of the turn sequence rules with the combat round rules. We abide by the rulebook so that fast actions can pass a signal all the way up to make the turn sequence rules stop after the combat round rules. ]
This is the abide by the combat round rules rule:
	abide by the combat round rules.
The abide by the combat round rules rule is listed instead of the parse command rule in the turn sequence rules.
The generate action rule is not listed in the turn sequence rules.

[ The turn count should be incremented only if the player faced the command prompt. The time of day however will change regardless. ]
A turn sequence rule when the combat status is combat (this is the inactive players don't increment the turn count rule):
	if the player did something is true:
		now the player did something is false;
	otherwise:
		decrement the turn count.
The inactive players don't increment the turn count rule is listed after the advance time rule in the turn sequence rules.

Section - Non-combat rules

A first combat round rule (this is the update the combat status rule):
	if the combat status is peace or the combat status is combat:
		update the combat status;

A combat round rule when the combat status is peace (this is the business as usual rule):
	now the main actor is the player;
	now the command prompt is the peaceful prompt;
	carry out the taking a player action activity;


Section - Combat rules

A combat round rule when the combat status is combat (this is the determine the main actor rule):
	rank participants by initiative;
	now the main actor is the next participant;
	now the combat state of the main actor is at-Act;

A combat round rule when the combat status is combat (this is the consider the starting the combat round rules rule):
	follow the starting the combat round rules.

A combat round rule when the combat status is combat (this is the main actor chooses an action rule):
	if the main actor is the player:
		now the command prompt is the action prompt;
		now the combat status is player choosing;
	otherwise:
		run the AI rules for the main actor;
		now the combat status is reactions;

[ The player now gets to choose an action. This rule is also used for choosing reactions, as the next combat status is the same: reactions.
This rule will loop until an appropriate action is chosen. ]
A combat round rule when the combat status is player choosing (this is the player chooses an action or reaction rule):
	carry out the taking a player action activity;
	if take no time boolean is false:
		if the combat state of the player is at-Act:
			now the main actor's action is the current action;
		now the combat status is reactions;
		now the player did something is true;
		make no decision;

A combat round rule when the combat status is reactions (this is the reactors choose reactions rule):
	while the number of entries in the participants list is greater than 0:
		let P be the next participant;
		[ We must check that the participant is still alive as they could have been killed by an action that didn't wait for a reaction. ]
		if P is an alive at-React person:
			if P is the player:
				now the command prompt is the reaction prompt;
				now the combat status is player choosing;
				rule succeeds;
			otherwise:
				run the AI rules for P;
	now the combat status is concluding;

A combat round rule when the combat status is concluding (this is the run delayed actions rule):
	sort the Table of Delayed Actions in random order;
	sort the Table of Delayed Actions in Action speed order;
	repeat through the Table of Delayed Actions:
		try the Action to take entry;
		blank out the whole row;

A combat round rule when the combat status is concluding (this is the conclude the combat round rule):
	[ Reset everyone to Inactive so that they'll have the right state in the next turn whether it's peace or combat. ]
	repeat with X running through all alive persons enclosed by the location:
		now the combat state of X is at-Inactive;
	update the combat status;

[ And if we get this far then we actually get to run the every turn rules! ]



Chapter - Reporting the main action again

[ It is useful to be able to report an action twice. For example if you open a menu when the player is reacting, the main actor's action should be re-reported when the menu is closed. This turns out to be quick tricky. ]
Reporting again is a truth state variable.

The report an action again rule is listed before the before stage rule in the action-processing rules.
This is the report an action again rule:
	if reporting again is true:
		follow the descend to specific action-processing rule;
		stop the action;

The report an action again part two rule is listed before the investigate player's awareness before action rule in the specific action-processing rules.
This is the report an action again part two rule:
	if reporting again is true:
		follow the specific report rulebook;
		now reporting again is false;
		stop the action;

[ Our helper phrase to report again the main action ]
To report the main action again:
	if the player is at-React:
		say "[italic type][run paragraph on]";
		now the meta flag is false;
		now reporting again is true;
		try the main actor's action;
		say "[roman type][run paragraph on]";



Chapter - Taking a player action

[ Taking a player action will keep requesting commands until a successful (non-out of world) command is obtained. ]
Taking a player action is an activity.

For taking a player action:
	follow the take-a-player-action rules.

The take-a-player-action rules are an action name based rulebook.

The parse command rule is listed first in the take-a-player-action rules.
The generate action rule is listed last in the take-a-player-action rules.



Chapter - Initiative

[ Initiative determines whose turn it is, and if an action puts several people at-React, the order in which they will react.

By default the initiative of the main actor will be reset each round, so that the participants will take turns, though occassionally you will get two turns in a row because of the random initiative rule. ]

A person has a number called the initiative.

[ Must rename because of an I7 bug where the rulebook name conflicts with the property name in the sort call below. ]
The initiative update rules are a rulebook.

Section - Standard initiative rules

First initiative update rule (this is the no low initiative trap rule):
	repeat with X running through all alive persons enclosed by the location:
		if the initiative of X is less than -2:
			now the initiative of X is -2.
		
Initiative update rule (this is the increase initiative every round rule):
	repeat with X running through all alive persons enclosed by the location:
		increase the initiative of X by 2.
	
Initiative update rule (this is the random initiative rule):
	repeat with X running through all alive persons enclosed by the location:
		increase the initiative of X by a random number between 0 and 2.

A starting the combat round rule (this is the reset the initiative of the main actor rule):
	now the initiative of the main actor is 0;

Section - Rebuilding the participants list

To rank participants by initiative:
	follow the initiative update rules;
	[ Passive people neither act nor react, so are not placed in the list. ]
	now the participants list is the list of alive not passive persons enclosed by the location;
	[ Sort everyone by current initiative, but if multiple people have the same initiative then randomise their relative order. ]
	sort the participants list in random order;
	sort the participants list in reverse initiative order;



Chapter - Fast actions

[ See manual section 2.1.4 ]

[ Some actions should take no time; we wish to ensure that examining, smelling, and so on do not take a turn. This will allow the player to look around during combat, which is to be encouraged. The variable is checked in the player chooses an action or reaction rule. ]

[ There are two ways to set the take no time boolean: by declaring an action acting fast, or by hand, by saying "take no time". ]
The take no time boolean is a truth state that varies. The take no time boolean is false.

To take no time:
	now the take no time boolean is true.

To say take no time:
	take no time.
	
[ Before taking a player action we must reset the boolean. ]
Before taking a player action (this is the reset take no time boolean rule):
	now the take no time boolean is false.

[ Set the boolean when trying a fast action. ]
Rule for setting action variables when acting fast (this is the acting fast actions are fast rule):
	now the take no time boolean is true.

[ All out of world actions are fast. ]
After taking a player action (this is the all out of world actions are fast rule):
	if the meta flag is true:
		now the take no time boolean is true.

This is the acting fast rule: [Stops the turn sequence rules before we reach the every turn rules.]
	if the take no time boolean is true:
		rule succeeds.
The acting fast rule is listed before the every turn stage rule in the turn sequence rules.

Section - Going is slow unindexed

[ The automatic look that happens after movement would make going fast, which we don't want! ]

The just moved boolean is a truth state that varies. The just moved boolean is false.

After going (this is the first make sure that going is not acting fast rule):
	now the just moved boolean is true;
	continue the action.

After looking (this is the second make sure that going is not acting fast rule):
	if the just moved boolean is true:	
		now the take no time boolean is false;
		now the just moved boolean is false;
	continue the action.

Section - Vaguely going

The block vaguely going rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Rule for supplying a missing noun while an actor going (this is the block vaguely going and take no time rule):
	take no time;
	say "You'll have to say which compass direction to go in." (A).

Section - Going nowhere

The can't go that way rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Check an actor going (this is the can't go that way and take no time rule):
	if the room gone to is nothing:
		take no time;
		if the door gone through is nothing:
			if the actor is the player:
				say "[We] [can't go] that way." (A);
			stop the action;
		if the actor is the player:
			say "[We] [can't], since [the door gone through] [lead] nowhere." (B);
		stop the action.

Section - Taking what is already carried

The can't take what's already taken rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take what's already taken and take no time rule):
	if the actor is carrying the noun or the actor is wearing the noun:
		if the actor is the player:
			take no time;
			say "[We] already [have] [regarding the noun][those]." (A);
		stop the action.


Volume - AI

[ Each person has an activity which controls what they do. It is person based so that the person themself is fed back into it. ]
A person has a person based rulebook called the AI rules.
The Standard AI rules is a person based rulebook.
The AI rules of a person is usually the Standard AI rules.

[ The AI rules can run for both actors and reactors, so store whose AI rules are currently running. ]
The running AI is a person variable.

[ Who the AI is choses to target ]
The chosen target is a person variable.

To run the AI rules for (P - a person):
	follow AI rules of P for P;

[ Our standard AI works in three stages.
	First, we choose a person to attack--if we were to attack.
	In the second stage, we choose a weapon. (Found in the ATTACK extension)
	In the third stage, we decide whether to attack or whether to do something else--like concentrating, dodging, readying a weapon, and so on.
	
These choices are made by a series of rulebooks which alter the weighting of each potential target/weapon/action. ]

Section - Showing AI weightings unindexed

Show AI weightings is a truth state variable.

To #if debug and showing weightings: (- #ifdef DEBUG; if ( (+ Show AI weightings +) ) { -).
To #endif debug and showing weightings: (- } #endif; -).

Section - Switching weightings on and off - not for release

Switching weightings on is an action out of world. Understand "weightings on" as switching weightings on.
Carry out switching weightings on (this is the standard switching weightings on rule):
	now show AI weightings is true;
	say "You will now see the AI weightings.".

Switching weightings off is an action out of world. Understand "weightings off" as switching weightings off.
Carry out switching weightings off (this is the standard switching weightings off rule):
	now show AI weightings is false;
	say "You will no longer see the AI weightings.".

[TODO: show initiative information?]

Chapter - The pressing relation

[ Pressing is mostly just a way to remember who had been attacking whom. The AI prefers continuing to attack the same person. It would be possible for someone to press multiple targets, but the phrase below will normally ensure that does not happen. ]
Pressing relates various people to various people. The verb to press (he presses, they press, he pressed, it is pressed, he is pressing) implies the pressing relation.

[ This phrase takes care of the pressing relationship ]
To have (A - a person) start pressing (B - a person):
	now A presses no one;
	now A presses B;



Chapter - Selecting a target

Table of AI Target Options
Person	Target weight
a person	a number
with 10 blank rows

The AI target selection rules are a person based rulebook producing a number.
The AI target selection rulebook has a number called the Weight.

A first Standard AI rule for a person (called P) (this is the select a target rule):
	[ If we already have a target (see the next rule) don't try to choose one again ]
	if the chosen target is not the stand in for no one:
		make no decision;
	let target count be the number of (alive people enclosed by the location) who are opposed by P;
	if P opposes P:
		decrease target count by 1;
	[ Don't consider further stages if we don't have a target. This won't happen unless you add new factions with uneven hate relationships. ]
	if target count is 0:
		rule succeeds;
	[ If there's only one potential target the choice is easy ]
	if target count is 1:
		now the chosen target is a random (alive people enclosed by the location) who is opposed by P;
		while chosen target is P:
			now the chosen target is a random (alive people enclosed by the location) who is opposed by P;
		make no decision;
	[ We have many potential targets to consider the AI target selection rules ]
	blank out the whole of the Table of AI Target Options;
	repeat with target running through (alive people enclosed by the location) who are opposed by P:
		unless target is P:
			let weight be the number produced by the AI target selection rules for target;
			choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Target Options;
			now the Person entry is target;
			now the Target weight entry is weight;
	sort the Table of AI Target Options in random order;
	sort the Table of AI Target Options in reverse Target weight order;
	#if debug and showing weightings;
	repeat through Table of AI Target Options:
		say "[Target weight entry]: [Person entry][line break]";
	#endif debug and showing weightings;
	choose row 1 in the Table of AI Target Options;
	now the chosen target is the Person entry;

[ Reactors can only choose the main actor. Unlist this rule if you want them to choose someone else. ]
A first Standard AI rule for an at-React person (called P) (this is the reactors target the main actor rule):
	now the chosen target is the main actor;

A first Standard AI rule for a person (called P) (this is the reset AI variables rule):
	now the running AI is P;
	now the chosen target is the stand in for no one;

An AI target selection rule for a passive person (this is the do not prefer passive targets rule):
	decrease the Weight by 5;

An AI target selection rule for a person (called target) (this is the prefer targets you press rule):
	if the running AI presses the target:
		increase the Weight by 3;

An AI target selection rule for a person (called target) (this is the prefer those who press you rule):
	if the target presses the running AI:
		increase the Weight by 1;

An AI target selection rule for the player (this is the prefer the player rule):
	increase the Weight by 1;

An AI target selection rule (this is the randomise the target result rule):
	increase the Weight by a random number between 0 and 4;

An AI target selection rule (this is the randomise the target result more rule):
	increase the Weight by a random number between 0 and 3;

A last AI target selection rule (this is the return the target weight rule):
	rule succeeds with result Weight;

Chapter - Selecting an action

Table of AI Action Options
Option	Action Weight
a stored action	a number
with 20 blank rows

The AI action selection rules are a person based rulebook.

A last Standard AI rule for a person (called P) (this is the select an action and do it rule):
	blank out the whole of the Table of AI Action Options;
	follow the AI action selection rules for P;
	sort the Table of AI Action Options in random order;
	sort the Table of AI Action Options in reverse Action Weight order;
	#if debug and showing weightings;

	[ Don't forget to do it! ]
	try the Option entry;
	[ Store it for reactions ]
	if P is at-Act:
		now the main actor's action is the Option entry;

[ Each potential action should have a First rule which will add the action to the Table of AI Combat Options.  Subsequent rules can then modify the Action Weight.

Actions which are limited to the Actor/Reactor should specify an at-Act/at-React person in the rule preamble. ]

Last AI action selection rule (this is the randomise the action result rule):
	repeat through the Table of AI Action Options:
		increase the Action Weight entry by a random number between 0 and 5;



Volume - Standard actions

Chapter - Waiting

Carry out an actor waiting (this is the waiting lets someone else go first rule):
	if the combat state of the actor is at-Act:
		let Y be 0;
		repeat with X running through all alive not passive persons enclosed by the location:
			if X is not the actor and the initiative of X is greater than Y:
				now Y is the initiative of X;
		now the initiative of the actor is Y - 2;
		if concentration of the actor > 1:
			decrease initiative of the actor by 1;
		if concentration of the actor > 2:
			decrease initiative of the actor by 1.

[Last report an actor waiting:
	if the actor is not the player:
		say "[CAP-actor] wait[s].".]

First AI action selection rule for a person (called P) (this is the consider waiting rule):
	choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Option entry is the action of P waiting;
	now the Action Weight entry is -20;
	[ Could definitely do with some more logic here! ]

Volume - Damage

[We will make the simplification that no source of damage will consist of multiple materials. So something can deal "physical damage", and then the material might be silver or iron or whatever; but we don't need to define different damage types for all materials.]

Chapter - Materials

Material is a kind of value. A thing has a material. 

[A material has a number called the corrosion resistance. [Percentile chance, because we are working with some small probabilities here -- they come up every turn, and get large quickly.]]
Heat-behaviour is a kind of value. The heat-behaviours are burner and melter. [A material has a heat-behaviour.]

The materials are defined by the Table of Materials.

Table of Materials
material	material-adjective	destroying heat	heat-behaviour	corrosion resistance
other-material	"nondescript"	5	burner	950					

Chapter - Damage types

Damage type is a kind.

Physical damage is a damage type.
Heat damage is a damage type.
Acid damage is a damage type.
Necromantic damage is a damage type.
Divine damage is a damage type.

Damage-source is a thing that varies.
Damage-material is a material that varies.
No-source is a thing. The material of no-source is other-material.


Section - Grouping damage types

[We do it here so we don't forget to update when adding a damage type.]

To decide whether (type - a damage type) is physical-body-only: [Immune when ethereal.]
	if type is physical damage and damage-material is radiance, decide no;
	if type is necromantic damage, decide no;
	if type is divine damage, decide no;
	decide yes.

Chapter - Damage Mechanics

Section - Rulebooks and globals

[We need a whole bunch of rulebooks.

1. Add damage of specific types.
2. Remove damage of specific types. (Can't go below 0, which is why we must add first.
3. Multiply specific types as appropriate. (E.g., "double heat damage".)

We then count al specific damage types, and get the total damage.

4. Add general damage. -- deleted, problematic. Use add specific damage with "primary damage" instead
5. Remove general damage.
6. Multiply general damage.

Deal damage!]

The before damage rules are a rulebook. [Probably used sparingly. Setup and convert damage types]
The add specific damage rules are a rulebook. [For rules pertaining to specific types of damage.]
The remove specific damage rules are a rulebook. [For rules pertaining to specific types of damage.]
The specific damage multiplier rules are a rulebook. [Idem, but rules that multiply the damage by a constant.]
The remove general damage rules are a rulebook. [Next two rulebooks idem, but for general damage.]
The general damage multiplier rules are a rulebook.
The after damage rules are a rulebook. [For things like losing concentration.]

The victim is a person that varies.
The total damage is a number that varies.

The unmodified damage is a number that varies. [the amount of damage specified before any effects can alter it]
Damage comment is a truth state that varies. [Automatically set to false, then to true by any rules that prints "+ .." or "- ..." damage.]
Damage silence is a truth state that varies. [Automatically set to true or false depending on whether "silently" is invoked.]

Damage-by-hitting is a truth state that varies. [Set to true when dealing damage from an attack, so rules know that global attacker/defender and weapon properties are available.]

Section - The damage profile

[Every damage type has a number. When we wish to deal harm, we first add harm of the appropriate damage type(s), and then we inflict the damage.]

A damage type has a number called the harm.

Primary damage is a damage type that varies.

Primary-damage-selected is a truth state that varies.

Section - Resetting damage profile

[We don't need to invoke this ourselves, since it is automatically invoked when damage is inflicted.]

To reset the damage profile:
	Now primary damage is physical damage;
	Now primary-damage-selected is false;
	repeat with q running through damage types:
		now the harm of q is 0.

Section - Dealing damage

[Invoke with phrases like "deal 2 points of fire damage".]

To deal (n - a number) points of (type - a damage type):
	if primary-damage-selected is false:
		now primary damage is type;
		now primary-damage-selected is true;
	increase the harm of type by n.

Section - Converting damage

to convert (old damage - a damage type) to (new damage - a damage type):
	now the harm of new damage is the harm of new damage + the harm of old damage;
	now the harm of old damage is 0;
	[automatically change primary damage. TODO: should we only do that with a separate phrase?]
	if old damage is primary damage and primary-damage-selected is true:
		now primary damage is new damage.

Section - Damage comments

To add damage comment (msg - a text):
	unless damage silence is true:
		say "[if damage comment is false][unmodified damage][end if] [msg][run paragraph on]";
		now damage comment is true;
	
Section - Adding specific damage

[Effects that add damage to an already established damage profile should do so using this phrase. You can add damage normally, which means the damage is always added; or conditional on damage of that type already being dealt. Heat vulnerability -- which adds 2 damage when heat damage is being dealt -- should add 2 points of heat damage conditionally; while a curse that adds 2 heat damage to any damage you get from any source should add the damage normally.]

To add (n - a number) points of (type - a damage type) with reason (reason - some text), conditionally:
	if not conditionally or harm of type is greater than 0:
		increase harm of type by n;
		unless n is 0:
			add damage comment "+ [n] ([reason])";

Section - Adding primary damage

[We don't add general damage because new damage without a type is too hard to deal with. Instead, we add primary damage when the type is not specified. Using this phrase allows us a debugging check]

To add (n - a number) points of damage with reason (reason - some text):
	if primary-damage-selected is false:
		say "[bold type]Programming error: primary damage not selected. Default value is [primary damage].[roman type]";
		now primary-damage-selected is true;
	increase harm of primary damage by n;
	unless n is 0:
		add damage comment "+ [n] ([reason])";

Section - Removing specific damage

[Any effect that removes, say, 2 fire damage, should do so using this phrase. It makes sure that the damage type doesn't drop below 0. "Removed damage" returns the total damage done, if needed. The reason is shown between brackets.]

Removed damage is a number that varies.

To remove (n - a number) points of (type - a damage type) with reason (reason - some text):
	if harm of type is less than n:
		now n is harm of type;
	decrease harm of type by n;
	now removed damage is n;
	unless removed damage is 0:
		add damage comment "- [removed damage] ([reason])";

Section - Multiplying specific damage

[Any effect that, say, doubles fire damage should do so using this phrase.]

[We're using Glulx, so we should never meet the limit of the naturals -- about 2 billion -- even if we multiply by 100. But we do want to be in the situation that  x 50% x 200% = x 100%, which we cannot completely guarantuee without using reals. We could add the full fixed point math extension, but I'm happy with an easy hack here.]

A damage type has a number called the rounding error.

To multiply (type - a damage type) by (percentage - a number) percent with reason (reason - some text):
	if harm of type is not 0:
		let n be harm of type;
		now n is n times percentage;
		increase n by ((percentage times rounding error of type) divided by 100);
		let m be n divided by 100;
		let p be m times 100;
		now rounding error of type is (n - p);
		let change be (m - harm of type);
		now harm of type is m;
		if change is less than 0:
			now change is (0 - change);
			add damage comment "- [change] ([reason])";
		otherwise if change is greater than 0:
			add damage comment "+ [change] ([reason])".

First specific damage multiplier rule (this is the reset rounding error rule):
	reset rounding errors.
	
To reset rounding errors:
	repeat with type running through damage types:
		now rounding error of type is 0.

[Example caculation. Heat damage is 7. Percentage is 50.
n = 7
n = 350
n = 350 + 0 = 350
m = 3
p = 300
rounding error = 50
heat damage = 3

Percentage is 200.
n = 3
n = 600
n = 600 + ((50 * 200)/100) = 700
m = 7
p = 700
rounding error = 0
heat damage = 7

As expected, since 0.5 x 2 = 1.]

[What we do not compensate for is this. Suppose I get 5 heat damage and 5 physical damage. Both are halved. I will then get 2 + 2 = 4 damage, rather than 5. We could add up remaining rounding errors and see that another point of damage ought to be dealt; but what type is it supposed to have, and how are we to indicate to the player what is happening? Better just ignore it. It's a feature, not a bug.]

Section - Removing total damage

To remove (n - a number) points of general damage with reason (reason - some text):
	if total damage is less than n:
		now n is total damage;
	decrease total damage by n;
	now removed damage is n;
	unless removed damage is 0:
		add damage comment "- [removed damage] ([reason])";

Section - Multiplying total damage

The general damage rounding error is a number that varies.

To multiply general damage by (percentage - a number) percent with reason (reason - some text):
	if total damage is not 0:
		let n be total damage;
		now n is n times percentage;
		increase n by ((percentage times general damage rounding error) divided by 100);
		let m be n divided by 100;
		let p be m times 100;
		now general damage rounding error is (n - p);
		now total damage is m;
		add damage comment "x [percentage]% ([reason])";

First general damage multiplier rule (this is the reset general rounding error rule):
	now general damage rounding error is 0.


Section - Inflicting damage

[Always call this when you're inflicting damage!]

To have (source - a thing) inflict damage on (guy - a person), silently:
	now the victim is guy;
	now damage-source is source;
	now damage-material is material of source;
	now damage comment is false;
	if silently:
		now damage silence is true;
	otherwise:
		now damage silence is false;
	now unmodified damage is 0;
	repeat with type running through damage types:
		increase unmodified damage by harm of type;
	follow the before damage rules; [Can convert damage types, but do not modify total damage amount here - use specific damage multiplier rules for immunities]
	now total damage is 0;
	follow the add specific damage rules;
	follow the remove specific damage rules;	
	follow the specific damage multiplier rules;
	repeat with type running through damage types:
		unless harm of type is less than 0:
			increase total damage by harm of type;
	follow the remove general damage rules;	
	follow the general damage multiplier rules;
	if total damage is less than 0:
		now total damage is 0;
	unless silently:
		say "[if damage comment is true] = [end if][bold type]", total damage, " damage[roman type][run paragraph on]";
	decrease health of the victim by total damage;
	follow the after damage rules;
	reset the damage profile;
	now damage-by-hitting is false;
	
To say the/-- damage we have (source - a thing) inflict on (guy - a person):
	say run paragraph on;
	have source inflict damage on guy;

[Note that this phrase says the victim loses concentration, but it doesn't do the concentration breaking itself TODO: fix that to work with silent options]
To say damage consequences:
	say "to [the victim][if victim is dead] (which is [bold type]lethal[roman type])[end if][if concentration of victim is greater than 0 and victim is alive and total damage is not 0] (which breaks [regarding the victim][possessive] concentration)[end if][run paragraph on]";

Chapter - Testing Damage

Testdamaging is an action applying to nothing. Understand "testdamage" as testdamaging.

Carry out testdamaging:
	deal 2 points of physical damage;
	deal 3 points of divine damage;
	have no-source inflict damage on player.

Check switching the numbers off:
	say "The numerical representation of combat cannot be switched off in this game." instead.

Section - The After reporting rules

[ The reporting rules are supposed to have the last word, but in Inform ATTACK sometimes that's just not acceptable. The After reporting rules allow us to get another word in. Like the After rules, they are shared for all (non out of world) actions. ]

[To make looting possible.]
The can't take people's possessions rule is not listed in any rulebook.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take living people's possessions rule):
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	let H be the not-counting-parts holder of the noun;
	while H is not nothing and H is not the local ceiling:
		if H is an alive person:

Chapter - Health

A person has a number called permanent health. [The maximum you can regain with healing.]

When play begins (this is the set permanent health to initial health rule):
	repeat with the patient running through people:
		now the permanent health of the patient is the health of the patient;

[We set the permanent health of each individual to the health it has at the beginning of the game. If we wish any character to start the game wounded or super-healthy, we will have to manually override this process.]

To restore the health of (patient - a person):
	now the health of the patient is the permanent health of the patient. 

To fully heal (patient - a person):
	if the permanent health of the patient is greater than the health of the patient:
		restore the health of the patient.

[The healed amount is a number that varies. The healed amount is usually 0.]

To heal (patient - a person) for (health - a number) health:
	let the health dummy be the permanent health of the patient minus the health of the patient;
	if health is less than the health dummy:
		now the health dummy is health;
	if the health dummy is less than 0:
		now the health dummy is 0;
	increase the health of the patient by the health dummy;
	[now the healed amount is the health dummy.] [For storage.]

	say " (readied)".

Weapon-readying relates a person (called the wielder) to a weapon (called the item) when the item is readied and the wielder encloses the item.

The verb to wield means the weapon-readying relation.

To decide which object is the current weapon of (guy - a person):
	decide on a random weapon wielded by guy.

Section - Weapon Stats

[ The damage die is the die size used to calculate damage. Base damage dealt by the weapon is 1d(damage die) + weapon damage bonus. So a standard weapon deals 1d6 damage; a weapon with a damage die of 0 and a weapon damage bonus of 5 always deals 5 damage, and so on. Negative damage die is counted as 0, but negative weapon damage bonus is possible. ]
A weapon has a number called the damage die. The damage die of a weapon is usually 6.
A weapon has a number called the weapon damage bonus. The weapon damage bonus of a weapon is usually 0.

Does the player mean readying a natural weapon:
	it is very unlikely.

Definition: a weapon is artificial if it is not a natural weapon.

Section - Making sure a weapon is always readied

To ready natural weapons:
	repeat with X running through all alive persons enclosed by the location:
		if X encloses no readied weapon:
			let item be a random natural weapon part of X;

The attack strength is a number variable.
The attack damage is a number variable.

[ The old system has been converted into an action. Instead of the old entry point system we now have:
	1: does attacking begin?
		add check an actor hitting rules
	2: preliminary results of attacking
		add first carry out an actor hitting rules
	3-6: basic attack roll, apply the attack modifiers, calculate results of the attack roll, show results of the attack roll
		these have been combined into the attack modifier rules
	7: did the attack hit?
		changed to first contact rules
	8: immediate results of hitting

]

Hitting is an action applying to one visible thing.
The specification of the hitting action is "When you attack Inform ATTACK must wait for a reaction from the target. In order to handle the resulting combat event the attacking action actually stores a new hitting action in the Table of Delayed Actions.".

[ Reset the variables ]
Setting action variables for hitting (this is the new reset hitting variables rule):
	now the global attacker is the actor;
	now the global defender is the noun;
	ready natural weapons;
	now the global attacker weapon is the current weapon of the actor;
	now the global defender weapon is the current weapon of the noun;
	have the actor start pressing the noun;
	now the attack strength is 0;
	now the attack damage is 0;
	now the total damage is 0;

Section - Checking that the hit can still occur

[ As a result of various reactions, it may no longer be possible to hit ]

First check an actor hitting (this is the stop hitting if either combatant is missing rule):

		stop the action;

First check an actor hitting (this is the stop hitting if either combatant is dead rule):
	if the global attacker is dead or the global defender is dead:
		stop the action;



Section - Calculating the attack roll

The attack modifier rules are a rulebook.

Carry out an actor hitting (this is the consider the attack modifier rules rule):
	follow the attack modifier rules;

[This roll creates a number between 1 and 10, but biased towards the middle values. This makes combat somewhat less random, which benefits the player and makes penalties and bonuses more important. However, we also allow a 10 to turn into a 20, so that everyone has a chance to hit everyone.

Instead of the standard 1d10 of ATTACK, we roll 1d7 + 1d4 - 1.]

The roller is a person that varies. [The guy who is rolling the dice. Used in the natural twenty rules.]
The special set attack strength rules are a rulebook. [Used for periapt of prophecy]

First attack modifier rule (this is the alternative attack roll rule):
	now roller is the global attacker;
	now the attack strength is 0;
	follow the special set attack strength rules;
	if attack strength is 0: [nothing intervened]
		now the attack strength is a roll of the dice;
	say "[italic type]Rolling ", the attack strength, "[run paragraph on]".
	
An attack modifier rule (this is the melee attack bonus rule):
	let the attacker's melee be the melee of the global attacker;
	if the numbers boolean is true and the attacker's melee is not 0:
		if the the attacker's melee is greater than 0:
			say " + ", the attacker's melee, " (inherent bonus)[run paragraph on]";
		otherwise:
			say " - ", 0 minus the attacker's melee, " (inherent penalty)[run paragraph on]";
	increase the attack strength by the attacker's melee;

Last attack modifier rule (this is the standard show results of the attack roll rule):
	if the numbers boolean is true:
		say " = ", the attack strength, ", [run paragraph on]";

The natural twenty chance is a number that varies.
The natural twenty rules are a rulebook.

To decide which number is a roll of the dice:
	let n be a random number between 1 and 7;
	let m be a random number between 0 and 3;
	let x be n + m;
	now natural twenty chance is 0;
	follow the natural twenty rules;
	if a random chance of natural twenty chance in 100 succeeds:
		now x is 20;
	decide on x.

[1: 1/28
2: 2/28
3: 3/28
4-7: 4/28
8: 3/28

Section - Whether the attack hits

Whether the attack hit is a truth state variable.

To decide whether the attack hit:
	decide on whether the attack hit.
	
To decide whether the attack missed:
	decide on whether or not (whether the attack hit) is false.
	
The contact rules are a rulebook.

Carry out an actor hitting (this is the abide by the contact rules rule):
	now whether the attack hit is false;
	abide by the contact rules;
	now whether the attack hit is true;

First contact rule (this is the standard whether the attack hit rule):
	if the attack strength is greater than the defence of the global defender:
		if the numbers boolean is true:
			say "[the global attacker] [beat] [regarding the global defender][possessive] defence rating of ", the defence of the global defender, ".";
	otherwise:
		if the numbers boolean is true:
			say "[the global attacker] [do] not overcome [regarding the global defender][possessive] defence rating of ", the defence of the global defender, "[roman type].";
		rule fails;



Section - Dealing damage

Dealing attack damage is an activity.

Carry out an actor hitting (this is the set up attack damage rule):
	carry out the dealing attack damage activity;
	say "[roman type][paragraph break]".
	
Before dealing attack damage (this is the before dealing normal attack damage rule):
	[TODO: consider what to do if the numbers boolean is false]
	if the numbers boolean is true:
		say "[roman type][The global attacker] [deal] [run paragraph on]";
	
For dealing attack damage (this is the for dealing normal attack damage rule):
	unless damage die of the global attacker weapon is less than 1:
		now the attack damage is a random number between 1 and the damage die of the global attacker weapon;
	increase the attack damage by weapon damage bonus of the global attacker weapon; [1d(damage die) + WDB]
	deal attack damage points of physical damage;

		say ", allowing [the global defender] to escape unscathed.[run paragraph on]";
		rule succeeds;
	
After dealing attack damage (this is the normal fatal attack rule):
	if the health of the global defender is not greater than 0:
		say ", killing [the name of the global defender].[run paragraph on]";
		rule succeeds;
	
After dealing attack damage (this is the normal non-fatal attack rule):
	say ", wounding [the global defender] to ", health of the global defender, " health.[run paragraph on]" ;
		
Section - Aftereffects

The aftereffects rules is a rulebook.

After reporting an actor hitting (this is the consider the aftereffects rules rule):
	if the player is alive:
		follow the aftereffects rules;

An aftereffects rule when the global defender is dead (this is the unready weapons of dead person rule):
	now all readied weapons enclosed by the global defender are not readied;

An aftereffects rule (this is the modify initiative based on combat results rule):
	if the total damage is greater than 0:
		decrease the initiative of the global defender by 2;
	otherwise:
		decrease the initiative of the global attacker by 2;

Section - Weapon interactions during aftereffects

To decide what object is whatever (item - a thing) struck:
	if the attack hit:
		if item is the global attacker weapon, decide on the global defender;
		if item is the global defender, decide on the global attacker weapon; [TODO: change this line to match asymmetry below?]
		[what about clothing?]
		decide on nothing;
	if item is the global attacker weapon:
		if the global defender is at parry, decide on the global defender weapon;
		if the global defender is at-block, decide on a random shield worn by the global defender;
		decide on nothing;
	[The next line makes this phrase asymmetrical -
	 the global attacker weapon can hit weapons and shields if it is projectile, but they can't hit it.]
	if the global attacker weapon is projectile, decide on nothing;
	if item is the global defender weapon and the global defender is at parry, decide on the global attacker weapon;
	if item is a shield worn by the global defender and the global defender is at-block, decide on the global attacker weapon;
	decide on nothing.

[This is for Israfel's fires, lion's shield, etc]
To decide whether (guy - a person) came too close to (item - a thing):
	unless guy is the global attacker, no;
	if the global attacker weapon is projectile, no;
	if the global attacker weapon is tethered and the global attacker weapon is not a natural weapon, no;
	if item is the global defender, yes;
	if item is not proximity-triggered, no;
	decide on whether or not the global defender encloses item;
	
Definition: a thing is proximity-triggered: no. [maybe there's a better name for this, and if so, maybe it can be applied to parrying weapons and stuff]

Definition: a shield is proximity-triggered:
	unless the global defender wears it, no;
	decide on whether or not the global defender is at-block;
	
Definition: clothing is proximity-triggered if someone wears it;

Section - Killing

[Most killing reports are defined with the individual monster's code]

Report the player hitting a dead pc (this is the report player suicide rule):
	say "Your attack ends your own life.";
	rule succeeds;

[TODO: move event to Kerkerkruip Events]
Last after reporting an actor hitting (this is the killing after attack rule):
	if the global defender is dead:
		have an event of the global attacker killing the global defender.

Book - Flow

Chapter - Offensive and Defensive Flow

A person has a number called offensive flow. The offensive flow of a person is usually 0.

A person has a number called defensive flow. The defensive flow of a person is usually 0.

An attack modifier rule (this is the offensive flow attack modifier rule):
	let n be offensive flow of the global attacker;
	if the numbers boolean is true:
		unless n is 0:
			if n > 0:

Book - Artificial Intelligence

[ Our standard AI works in three stages.
	First, we choose a person to attack--if we were to attack.
	In the second stage, we choose a weapon.
	In the third stage, we decide whether to attack or whether to do something else--like concentrating, dodging, readying a weapon, and so on.
	
These choices are made by a series of rulebooks which alter the weighting of each potential target/weapon/action.

Inform ATTACK Core has the base rules - we now add combat specific ones. ]

The AI action selection rulebook have a number called the chance-to-lose.

[TODO: chance-to-lose is new! This is the main actor's chance to win, so that number can be used by an at-react AI to figure out the best defence more effectively - including deciding whether there's any point defending at all.

In order for this to work, the chance-to-win rules must be run for the PLAYER whenever the player attacks an NPC.]

First AI action selection rule (this is the calculate the chance to win rule):

Volume - Plug-ins

Chapter - Reloadable Weapons (Standard Plug-in)

A weapon has a number called the maximum shots. The maximum shots of a weapon is usually 0.
A weapon has a number called the current shots. The current shots of a weapon is usually 0.
A weapon has a number called the maximum load time. The maximum load time of a weapon is usually 0. 
A weapon has a number called the current load time. The current load time of a weapon is usually 0.

Definition: a weapon is unloaded if its current shots is 0 and its maximum shots is greater than 0.
Definition: a weapon is reloadable if its maximum shots is greater than 0.
Definition: a weapon is waiting to be reloaded if its current shots is 0 and its maximum shots is greater than 0 and its maximum load time is greater than 0.

A weapon has a text called the shots text. The shots text of a weapon is usually "shots".
A weapon has a verb called the reload verb. The reload verb of a weapon is usually the verb reload.
A weapon has a text called the out-of-ammo text. The out-of-ammo text of a weapon is usually "You pull the trigger, but nothing happens--you're out of ammo!".

[Maximum shots: number of rounds the weapon can be used when fully loaded. Current shots: number of shots still loaded. Maximum load time: number of rounds it takes to load the weapon. Current load time: number of rounds it still takes to load the weapon.]

When play begins (this is the set current load time rule):
	repeat with item running through reloadable weapons:
		now current load time of item is maximum load time of item.

[Set maximum shots to 0 for any weapon that shouldn't use these statistics. Set maximum load time to -1 in case a weapon cannot be reloaded. NEVER set maximum load time to 0 for a weapon with maximum shots not 0.]

[The basic system does NOT deal with ammo. Everyone is assumed to have infinite ammunition.]

After printing the name of a weapon (called item) when taking inventory (this is the show ammo in inventory rule):
	if the maximum shots of item is not 0:
		if the current shots of item is not 0:
			say " ([current shots of item] of [maximum shots of item] [shots text of item] left)";
		otherwise:
			if the maximum load time of item is not -1:
				say " (no [shots text of item] left; [current load time of item] round[if current load time of item is not 1]s[end if] [infinitive of reload verb of item])";
			otherwise:
				say " (no [shots text of item] left; cannot be [past participle of reload verb of item])".

After an actor hitting when the maximum shots of the global attacker weapon is greater than 0 (this is the decrease ammo rule):
	decrease the current shots of the global attacker weapon by 1;
	continue the action;

Check attacking (this is the cannot attack when out of ammo rule):
	let item be the current weapon of the player;
	if item is unloaded:
		say "[out-of-ammo text of item][paragraph break]" instead.

Section - Reloading

Reloading is an action applying to one carried thing.

Understand "reload [held weapon]" as reloading.

Does the player mean reloading an unloaded readied weapon enclosed by the player: it is very likely.
Does the player mean reloading an unloaded weapon enclosed by the player: it is likely.

Check reloading when the maximum shots of the noun is 0 (this is the cannot reload weapons that use no ammo rule):
	take no time;
	say "[The noun] [do not use] ammunition." instead;
	
Check reloading when the maximum load time of the noun is -1 (this is the cannot reload unreloadable weapons rule):	
	take no time;
	say "[The noun] [cannot] be [past participle of reload verb of noun]." instead;
	
Check reloading when the current shots of the noun is the maximum shots of the noun (this is the cannot reload fully loaded weapons rule):	
	take no time;
	say "[The noun] [are] already loaded." instead.

Carry out an actor reloading a not readied weapon (this is the ready upon reloading rule):
	silently try readying the noun;

Carry out an actor reloading (this is the zero current ammo on reloading rule):
	now current shots of the noun is 0.
	
Carry out an actor reloading (this is the standard carry out reloading rule):
	decrease the current load time of the noun by 1;
	if the current load time of the noun is less than 1:
		now the current shots of the noun is the maximum shots of the noun;
		now the current load time of the noun is the maximum load time of the noun.

Report an actor reloading (this is the standard report reloading rule):
	if the current load time of the noun is the maximum load time of the noun:
		say "[The actor] [if the maximum load time of the noun is 1][adapt reload verb of the noun][otherwise][finish] [present participle of reload verb of the noun][end if] [the noun].";
	otherwise:
		say "[The actor] [if the current load time of the noun plus 1 is the maximum load time of the noun][start][otherwise][continue][end if] [present participle of reload verb of the noun] [the noun].".
		
Section - Nounless reloading

Nounless reloading is an action applying to nothing.

Understand "reload" as nounless reloading.

Instead of nounless reloading:
	if the player wields an unloaded weapon:
		let item be a random unloaded weapon wielded by the player;
		try reloading item;
	otherwise if the player wields a reloadable weapon:
		take no time;
		let item be a random reloadable weapon wielded by the player;
		say "[The item] [are] already loaded.";
	otherwise:
		take no time;
		say "You'll have to specify which weapon you want to reload.".

Section - Reloading and choosing a weapon AI rules

[Weapons with high load times and limited ammo should not be given a penalty if they are already readied and full; some penalty if they are not readied; and a larger penalty if they are not readied and out of ammo.]

[ Move unloaded into the preample? ]
An AI weapon selection rule for an unloaded weapon (called W) (this is the do not choose an empty weapon that cannot be reloaded rule):
	if the maximum load time of W is -1:
		decrease the Weight by 1000;

An AI weapon selection rule for a weapon (called W) (this is the do not prefer weapons that need to be reloaded rule):
	if W is not readied or the current shots of W is 0:
		if the maximum shots of the W is not 0:
			if the maximum load time of the W is greater than 0:
				let m be the maximum shots of the W;
				let n be the maximum load time of the W;
				let x be m times 10;
				let y be m + n;
				now x is x divided by y; [Now x is roughly 10 times the fraction of time spent shooting in a shoot-reload cycle.]
				now x is 10 minus x; [Now x is roughly 10 times the fraction of time NOT spent shooting in a shoot-reload cycle.]
				if the current shots of the W is not 0: [This means that the weapon is (somewhat) loaded, but not ready. Using such a weapon can be done without ever reloading it: we ready it, shoot until empty, then ready a new weapon. This is AS IF we had to reload for two rounds in order to shoot as many shots as the weapon currently has. We now calculate this, and if it's better than the previous calculation, we substitute it for it.]
					now n is 2;
					now m is the current shots of the W;
					let z be m times 10;
					let y be m + n;
					now z is z divided by y;
					now z is 10 minus z;
					if z is less than x, now x is z;
				decrease the Weight by x;
	
[Example: a weapon that takes 1 turn to reload and gives you 1 shot gets a -5 penalty. A weapon that takes 3 turns to reload and gives you 1 shot gets a -8 penalty. A weapon that takes 1 turn to reload and gives you 5 shots gets a -2 penalty. ]

[Weapons with 0 ammo and a maximum load time of -1 should NOT be chosen.]

[ We will only load an unloaded weapon. ]
First AI action selection rule for a person (called P) when the chosen weapon is waiting to be reloaded (this is the consider reloading rule):
	choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Option entry is the action of P reloading the chosen weapon;
	now the Action Weight entry is 5.

An AI action selection rule for a person (called P) when the chosen weapon is unloaded (this is the don't attack or concentrate with an unloaded weapon rule):
	if P is at-Act:
		choose row with an Option of the action of P attacking the chosen target in the Table of AI Action Options;
		now the Action Weight entry is -1000;
	choose row with an Option of the action of P concentrating in the Table of AI Action Options;
	now the Action Weight entry is -100;



Chapter - Tension (Standard Plug-in)

[Tension is a standard plug-in, since I believe almost any game will benefit from it. Tension is a kind of "drama manager" for combat: it makes sure that long periods in which no apparent progress is made--that is, in which no damage is done--are not experienced as boring, but rather as increasing the tension. The way it works is that every turn when no hit is scored, the tension (a number that varies) is increased by one. High tension gives everyone bonuses on the attack roll, thus increasing the likelihood that something will happen, and on the attack damage roll, thus increasing the stakes.

Tension also works as a check and balance on the combat system: if you have made it too hard for people to hit each other, tension will greatly alleviate this problem.]

The tension is a number that varies. The tension is usually 0.

Every turn (this is the standard increase or reset the tension rule):
	if the combat status is peace:
		now the tension is 0;
	otherwise:
		increase the tension by 1;
		if the tension is greater than 20:
			now the tension is 20.

This is the additional reset the tension rule:
	if combat status is peace:
		now tension is 0.
	
The additional reset the tension rule is listed before the business as usual rule in the combat round rules.	
	
An attack modifier rule (this is the standard tension attack modifier rule):
	let the tension bonus be the tension divided by 2;
	if the tension bonus is not 0:
		if the numbers boolean is true:
			say " + ", the tension bonus, " (tension)[run paragraph on]";
		increase the attack strength by the tension bonus;
		
An add specific damage rule (this is the new tension damage modifier rule):
	if damage-by-hitting is true:
		let the bonus be the tension divided by 3;
		if the bonus is not 0:
			add bonus points of damage with reason "tension".

The new tension damage modifier rule is listed last in the add specific damage rules.

To decide what number is the tension after hit:
	Let T be the tension minus 4;
	now T is T times 8;
	now T is T divided by 10;
	if T is less than 0:
		now T is 0;
	decide on T.

An aftereffects rule when the total damage is greater than 0 (this is the standard reduce tension after hit rule):
	now the tension is the tension after hit.

[A hit must reduce the tension, but not necessarily completely down to 0. We want low tensions to be completely removed by a hit, but larger tension to be removed only partly. The standard rule leads to the following table:

0 -> 0
1 -> 0
2 -> 0
3 -> 0
4 -> 0
5 -> 0
6 -> 1
7 -> 2
8 -> 2
9 -> 3
10 -> 4
11 -> 4
12 -> 5
13 -> 6
14 -> 7
15 -> 7
16 -> 8
17 -> 9
18 -> 9
19 -> 10
20 -> 11

So if the current tension is 10, my attack will have an attack bonus of +5 and a damage bonus of +3. If I hit, the tension will drop to 4, will then be immediately raised to 5 by the every turn rule, and my opponent's attack the next round will be made at a +2 to attack and +1 to damage.

You can see that if the current tension is 10 and I am maximally concentrated, my attack is made at a gigantic +13 attack bonus, and will deliver a +7 damage bonus. ]
		
Chance to win rule (this is the CTW tension bonus rule):
	increase the chance-to-win by the tension divided by 2.

An AI action selection rule for an at-Act person (called P) (this is the tension influences attacking rule):
	choose row with an Option of the action of P attacking the chosen target in the Table of AI Action Options;
	increase the Action Weight entry by the tension divided by 4.

Section - Faculty increase

Unallocated faculty is a number that varies. Unallocated faculty is 0.

[The grant routine is called by power transferral in Kerkerkruip Systems.]

To grant a faculty increase of (n - a number):
	increase unallocated faculty by n;
	say "[We] [can] now increase one of [our] faculties by [bold type][unallocated faculty] point[if unallocated faculty is not 1]s[end if][roman type]. (Type 'body', 'mind', or 'spirit', depending on [our] choice.) [run paragraph on]".
	
Last status skill rule (this is the unallocated faculty rule):

		say "[italic type][We] [can] increase one of [our] faculties by [bold type][unallocated faculty] point[if unallocated faculty is not 1]s[end if][italic type]. (Type 'body', 'mind', or 'spirit', depending on [our] choice. This action takes no time.)[roman type][line break][run paragraph on]".

Increasing body is an action out of world. Understand "body" as increasing body.
Increasing mind is an action out of world. Understand "mind" as increasing mind.
Increasing spirit is an action out of world. Understand "spirit" as increasing spirit.

Check increasing body:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "[We] [do not have] any points left!" instead.

Check increasing mind:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "[We] [do not have] any points left!" instead.

Check increasing spirit:
	if unallocated faculty is less than 1:
		say "[We] [do not have] any points left!" instead.

[Okay, this is where I draw the line. My obsession with adaptive text may be extreme, but this would be ridiculous to implement as adaptive - Mike]

Carry out increasing body:
	increase body score of the player by unallocated faculty;
	say "[Our] basic body increases to [body score of the player]; [our] effective body is now [run paragraph on][final body of the player].[line break][paragraph break]";
	now unallocated faculty is 0.
