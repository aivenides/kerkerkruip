Chapter - Groups of enemies

[ Sometimes enemies are grouped together. We will use a relationship to link a leading enemy with its companions, and properties of each leader will describe the nature of each grouping. ]

Accompaniment relates various people to one person (called the leader).
The verb to accompany (he accompanies, they accompany, he accompanied, it is accompanied, he is accompanying) implies the accompaniment relation. 

Definition: a person is a grouper if it relates to a person by the accompaniment relation.

A person can be group leading.
A person can be initially accompanied. A group leading person is usually initially accompanied.
A person can be kills claiming. A group leading person is usually kills claiming.
A person can be defeated individually.

[This phrase applies even if the guy is dead - in which case, he WAS the sole survivor...]

Definition: a person (called guy) is sole survivor:
	let the leader be the guy;
	if the guy is grouper:
		now the leader is the leader of guy;
		if the leader is alive and the leader is on-stage:
			decide no;
	otherwise:
		if the guy is defeated individually or the guy is not group leading:
			decide yes;
	repeat with follower running through people who accompany the leader:
		if the follower is alive and the follower is on-stage and the follower is not guy:
			decide no;
	yes.
		
[ Place all the groupers with their leaders ]
Final monster placement rule (this is the place accompanying enemies with their leader rule):
	repeat with X running through on-stage group leading people:
		if X is initially accompanied:
			now all the people who accompany X are in the location of X.

Section - and the tentacle constricts

Tentacle-constricting is an action applying to nothing.

Constriction level is a number that varies. Constriction level is 0.

An AI action selection rule for the at-Act giant tentacle (this is the tentacle considers constricting rule):
	if the giant tentacle grapples the chosen target:
		choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
		now the Option entry is the action of the giant tentacle tentacle-constricting;
		now the Action Weight entry is 15;

Clothing has a number called the constriction prevention. The constriction prevention of clothing is usually 0.

Definition: clothing (called item) is constriction-preventing if the constriction prevention of item is greater than 0.

To protect is a verb.
Carry out the giant tentacle tentacle-constricting:
	increase constriction level by 1; [constricts tighter]
	let n be constriction level;

Section - and the tentacle shakes

Tentacle-shaking is an action applying to nothing.
		
An AI action selection rule for the at-React giant tentacle (this is the tentacle shakes when attacked and grappling rule):

		choose a blank Row in the Table of AI Action Options;
		now the Option entry is the action of the the giant tentacle tentacle-shaking;
		now the Action Weight entry is 15 plus 5 times the concentration of the main actor;

Carry out the giant tentacle tentacle-shaking:
	say "The giant tentacle vigourously shakes [the main actor] while projecting the horrifying image of Tooloo.[italic type] [run paragraph on]";
	let n be 12;
	increase n by a random number between 1 and tension;

		if the concentration of the main actor is greater than 0:
			say " [run paragraph on]";
			have the main actor lose concentration with penalty n;
		otherwise:

A person can be tentacle-confused. A person is usually not tentacle-confused.

An attack modifier rule (this is the tentacle-confused attack modifier rule):
	if the global attacker is tentacle-confused:
		say " - 2 (confused)[run paragraph on]";
		decrease the attack strength by 2.	

Chance to win rule when the global attacker is tentacle-confused (this is the CTW confusion penalty rule):

Section - and the tentacle throws

Tentacle-throwing is an action applying to nothing.

[First we set one of three throwing behaviours -- the player doesn't know which one. Behaviour 1 is linear with grappling strength but rare, behaviour 2 throws only with high grappling strength, behaviour 3 is a less predidtable version of 2.]

linear-tentacle-throw is a starting kit. The recipient is the giant tentacle.

Section - Reactions and Stealing Weapons

[TODO: steal more weapons instead of readying?]

To decide whether mercy is unarmed:
	decide on whether or not the angel of mercy wears the gauntlet of attraction and the angel of mercy does not enclose an artificial weapon.

To decide whether mercy can steal from (guy - a person):
	unless guy actively opposes the angel of mercy:
		no;
	if guy is hidden:
		no;
	unless gauntlet can steal current weapon of guy for the angel of mercy:
		no;
	decide on whether or not current weapon of guy is angel-worthy.

To decide whether mercy can reflect at (guy - a person):
	unless the angel of mercy wears the shield of reflection:
		no;
	unless guy actively opposes the angel of mercy:
		no;
	if guy is hidden:
		no;
	decide on whether or not current weapon of guy is ranged.
	
To decide which number is the angel-stealable weapon count:
	let weapon-count be 0;
	now opposition test subject is the angel of mercy;
	repeat with guy running through opposer people in the location of the angel of mercy:
		if mercy can steal from guy:
			increase weapon-count by 1;
	decide on weapon-count.

Definition: a weapon (called item) is angel-worthy:
	if item is epic, no;
	if item is deathly, no;
	if item is tricky, no;
	yes.

[weapons to avoid:
	demon blade (cursed) - original owner is a demonic person

[mercy passiveness determines whether the angel is likely to attack or to prevent attacks

0 or less means attack
1 means prefer reflecting ranged attacks to attacking
> 1 means avoid attacking
]

To decide what number is the mercy passiveness:
	Let n be the angel-stealable weapon count - the angel-reflectable weapon count;
	unless mercy is unarmed:
		if n > 0:
			now n is the size number of the angel of mercy - 2;

Section - Mercy for Runners

To run is a verb.
To escape is a verb.

The obstructed runner is an object that varies.

To decide what object is mercy-retreat-direction:
	Let way be the best route from the location to the retreat location;
	if the way is a direction, decide on the way;
	decide on the best route from the location to Entrance Hall.
	
A parting shot rule for the Angel of Mercy:

		rule fails;
	rule succeeds.
	
Instead of the Angel of Mercy hitting a runner person (this is the Angel of Mercy obstructs runners rule):
	say "The Angel of Mercy cries out, 'Do not pass!' and moves to block [regarding the noun][possessive] escape.[run paragraph on]";
	if the Angel of Mercy is gargantuan:
		say "[run paragraph on] [The noun] [attempt] to get by, but the angel is just too big.[paragraph break]";

	otherwise:
		now the total damage is 0;
		if radiation of the Angel of Mercy is at least 1:
			say "[paragraph break][The noun] [attempt] to get by without being burned. [run paragraph on]";
			have the angel of mercy damage the noun by obstruction;
		otherwise:

An impeded movement rule (this is the obstruction impedes movement rule):
	if the test subject is the obstructed runner:

Every turn (this is the free the obstructed runner rule):
	now the obstructed runner is nothing.

To have the angel of mercy damage (guy - a person) by obstruction:
	if the radiation of the Angel of Mercy is 0, stop;
	Let D be radiation of the Angel of Mercy - 1;
	increase D by a random number from 0 to radiation of the Angel of Mercy;
	increase D by a random number from 0 to (radiation of the Angel of Mercy / 2);
	increase D by the size number of the Angel of Mercy;
	Let n be D + 10 + (a random number from 0 to final body of the player * 2 / 3);
	test the body of the player against n;
	[TODO: have Sul intervene?]
	if test result is false:
		say " [The angel of mercy's body] [bold type]burns[roman type] [no dead property][the guy][dead property] for [run paragraph on]";
		deal D points of heat damage;

	Let B be final body of guy;
	if B < 1, now B is 1; [always some chance, even with 0 body]
	decide on whether or not B chances of target in 100 succeed.

To decide what number is the percent target for obstruction of (guy - a person) by the angel of mercy:
	Let N be the size number of the Angel of Mercy + the size number of the guy;
	[if we make this roll 6 times (body score of 6) we want a pretty linear rate of success]
	if N is at most -2:
		decide on 74; [74% chance of failure on each roll, with 6 rolls it's about 1/6 chance of obstruction]
	if N is -1:

	if N is 0:
		decide on 89; [89% chance of failure]
	if N is 1:
		decide on 93; [93% chance of failure]
	if N is 2:
		decide on 97; [97% chance of failure on each roll, with 6 rolls it's about 5/6 chance of obstruction]
	[N is 3 or more, eg player is medium, angel is gargantuan]

[TODO: the angel should do an average of 7 damage in order to get past it when the player has a body score of 5.

Section - Begging for Mercy

Begging for mercy is an action applying to nothing.

Understand "beg" as begging for mercy.

Understand the commands "plead" or "petition" as "beg".

Understand "beg [mercy]" and "beg for [mercy]" as begging for mercy.

Understand "mercy" and "pity" and "forgiveness" and "clemency" and "pardon" as "[mercy]".

Understand "[mercy]" as the angel of mercy. [this is a shortcut so we don't have to create a separate object representing the concept of mercy rather than the person]

Understand "beg [someone] for [something]" and "request [something] from/of [someone]" as asking it for.

To heed is a verb.
To grant is a verb.

Check asking someone for something:
	if the second noun is the angel of mercy:
		if the noun is the angel of mercy:
			instead try begging for mercy;
		otherwise:
			say "[The noun] [grant] you no mercy." instead;
	if the noun is the angel of mercy and the angel of mercy actively opposes the player:
		say "'All I can give you is mercy, or a quick death,' the angel of mercy replies." instead;
	otherwise:
		say "[The noun] [do not heed] your request." instead.
		
Generally asking for is an action applying to one thing. [This doesn't do much, but it helps to give a hint if you're in the room with the angel of mercy]

Understand "ask for [something]" and "beg for [something]" and "request [something]" as generally asking for.

Check generally asking for:
	if the angel of mercy is in the location:
		instead try asking the angel of mercy for the noun;
	say "No one listens to your request." instead.

Check begging for mercy:
	unless the angel of mercy is in the location and the angel of mercy actively opposes the player:
		say "No one listens to your plea." instead.		

Check begging for mercy:
	unless the angel of mercy opposes the player:
		say "The angel is already on your side." instead.

begging-count is a number that varies.
mercy-wasted is a truth state that varies.
mercy-command-broken is a truth state that varies;

Carry out attacking when the angel of mercy is merciful:
	break the angel of mercy's command;
	if the angel of mercy is within the location:
		if the angel of mercy is sleeping in this world:

	Let boon-list be a list of things;
	add the angel of mercy to boon-list;
	if the hand of glory is off-stage, add the hand of glory to boon-list;

Section - Power

The power of mercy is a power. The angel of mercy grants the power of mercy.
The power level of power of mercy is 3.
The command text of power of mercy is "mercy power".
The description of power of mercy is "Type: passive ability.[paragraph break]Command: none.[paragraph break]Effect: Any time you are damaged in combat, you will grow smaller. You also have a chance to become more radiant, which increases with your spirit. This effect lasts until combat is over."

The power-name of power of mercy is "power of mercy".

[WIth two nice items, I don't think we need an active ability... but here's what it was going to be:

[paragraph break]Command: pardon.[paragraph break]As reaction, you can forgive your attacker for seeking to harm you. This reduces the damage you receive from them by (your spirit / 4). This damage reduction will occur every time that person hits you, until you attack them back. If someone you have pardoned hits you, they must succeed at a spirit check against (your spirit + 4) or lose 1 point of spirit.

You can also [bold type]pardon[roman type] your attacker, softening the blow and weakening their spirit. [italic type](Level 3)[roman type][line break][run paragraph on]".

	now every person is not pardoned.

[TODO: grant eyeless vision? immune to radiance? or just protect from own flash power?]
[pardon power: makes it harder for enemy to hit/damage you, but only until you hit back, and only usable after they hit you... or force them to retreat?

Section - Power of Mercy - Aftereffects

mercy-radiation is a number that varies. mercy-radiation is 0.

To diminish is a verb.

Aftereffects rule (this is the mercy damage rule):
	if global defender is the player and the total damage is greater than 0:
		if power of mercy is granted:
			let previous-size be the size of the player;
			if previous-size > tiny:
				["hate is present" is deprecated, but it's not safe to update the combat status here, because this can happen when combat status needs to be concluding]

					if test result is true:
						say "You gain a level of radiance!";
						increase mercy-radiation by 1;
						increase the radiation of the player by 1;
					otherwise:
						say "Your spirit was not strong enough to increase your radiance this time.";
						
[
approx mercy spirit score targets:

damage	min target	avg target	max target
1	20	35	50

3	13
4	11
5	10	15	20
6	9
7	8
8	7
9	7
10	6		9

This comes to approximately x/sqrt(damage) where x is the min/avg/max with 1 damage

We create a curve with four die rolls, then divide by 4

To make the square root more accurate, we square the target and divide before taking the square root - that's how we get 400 and 2500.

Every turn when mercy-radiation is not 0 (this is the revert back to normal radiance rule):
	if combat status is peace and the player is the true body of the player:

		if base-radiation is 0:
			say "All of your radiance is extinguished with your mercy.";
		otherwise:
			say "With your mercy extinguished, you revert to [base-radiation] levels of radiance.";

The smoke demon time-out is a number that varies. The smoke demon time-out is 0.

Every turn when the smoke demon time-out is not 0:
