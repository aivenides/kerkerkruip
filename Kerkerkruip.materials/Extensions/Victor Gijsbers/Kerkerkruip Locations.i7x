[Instead of attacking the statue of Nomos:
	say "For aeons, warmth and coldness, air and water, and all the internal material tensions have wrought their slow changes on the atomic structure of the statue of Nomos. This is the exact moment when the critical limit is reached, and Nomos[apostrophe] massive marble fist breaks free and surrenders itself to the laws of gravity. Your body underneath is forced to surrender as well.";

Instead of attacking the statue of Nomos:

Chapter - Quartering Room

The quartering room is a room. "The smell of decay here is overwhelming. A large pile of human body parts lies in a corner."

The Quartering Room is connectable.
The Quartering Room is not connection-inviting.
The Quartering Room is placeable.
The Quartering Room is habitable.
The Quartering Room is treasurable.
The Quartering Room is vp-agnostic.
The Quartering Room is deathly.

Instead of smelling in the Quartering Room:
	say "The stench of rotting bodies overwhelms everything else.".

The large pile of body parts is scenery in the Quartering Room.
Understand "human" and "non-human" and "part" and "legs" and "arms" and "heads" and "intestines" and "bodies" as the large pile of body parts.

Description of the large pile of body parts is "A gruesome collection of legs, arms, heads, intestines, and all other parts of the human body. If you really wanted to, you could search it for treasures.".

Instead of taking the large pile of body parts:
	say "You definitely do not want any of the body parts.".

Pile search count is a number variable.

[ The probabilities of finding a healthy scroll, unhealthy scroll, or the corpse depends on how many times we've searched the pile already. The chance of finding both a healthy scroll and the corpse increases the more we search. ]
Instead of searching the large pile of body parts:
	let N be a random number between 0 and 99;
	if pile search count is:
		-- -1:
			say "You find nothing else in the pile." instead;
		-- 0:
			if N < 60:
				find an unhealthy scroll;
			otherwise if N < 90:
				find a healthy scroll;
			otherwise:
				find the corpse;
		-- 1:
			if N < 35:
				find an unhealthy scroll;
			otherwise if N < 85:
				find a healthy scroll;
			otherwise:
				find the corpse;
		-- 2:
			if N < 10:
				find an unhealthy scroll;
			otherwise if N < 50:
				find a healthy scroll;
			otherwise:
				find the corpse;
		-- otherwise:
			if N < 10:
				find an unhealthy scroll;
			otherwise if N < 30:
				find a healthy scroll;
			otherwise:
				find the corpse;
	increment pile search count;

To find an unhealthy scroll:
	find a scroll of type random deathly findable scroll name;

To find a healthy scroll:
	find a scroll of type random not deathly findable scroll name;

[
This phrase expects N to be an un-obfuscated scroll name. If it is not, you'll get an obfuscated scroll that can't be identified and does nothing.

Using the "healthy" and "unhealthy" adjectives above prevents that from ever happening, as long as there is at least one real scroll. But it feels like a hack to me. If more bugs are found related to this problem, I might try to refactor.

- Mike Ciul
]
To find a scroll of type (N - scroll name):
	let the template be the default value of scroll;
	repeat with S running through scrolls:
		if the true name of S is N:
			now the template is S;
			break;
	let the new scroll be a new object cloned from the template;
	now the new scroll is carried by the player;
	set pronouns from the new scroll;
	say "You have found [a new scroll][one of] in between the body parts[or] buried in the pile[at random]. It's slightly [one of]wet and smelly[or]covered in slime[at random], but it looks like it will still work, so you scoop it up.";

To find the corpse:
	if a random chance of 14 in 15 succeeds:
		if rotting corpse is off-stage and rotting corpse is alive:
			say "As you search the pile, a rotting corpse jumps out!";
			move rotting corpse to location of the large pile of body parts;
			if the player is hidden:
				say "[line break]Startled, you jump back. A curse escapes your lips, thus blowing your cover.";
				now the player is not hidden;
		otherwise:
			say "The most valuable thing you find is a putrefying arm that might function as a club.";
			move putrefying arm to player;
	otherwise:
		if a random chance of 4 in 5 succeeds:
			if the hand of glory is off-stage:
				say "The most valuable thing you find is an embalmed hand gripping a candle.";
				move hand of glory to player;
			otherwise:
				say "The most valuable thing you find is a putrefying arm that might function as a club.";
				move putrefying arm to player;
		otherwise:
			say "You find an evil object of immense power, the [bold type]hand of Vecna[roman type]!";
			move hand of vecna to player;
	now pile search count is -2; [ Account for the increment ]

The putrefying arm is a weapon.
The description of putrefying arm is "Although it smells terribly, this arm is actually quite sturdy. You could beat people with it.".
The damage die of putrefying arm is 8.
The weapon attack bonus of putrefying arm is 1.
Instead of smelling putrefying arm:
	say "It is horrible.".

[In a huge beast skeleton?]
 [a white stairway that mounted amid the veering vapors. Behind him the flames rose unbroken, like a topless rampart; and on either hand, from instant to instant, the smoke shaped itself into demon forms and faces that menaced him]
[Presently he came to the huge, browless skull of an uncouth creature, which reposed on the ground with upward-gazing orbits; and beyond the skull was the monster's moldly skeleton, wholly blocking the passage. Its ribs were cramped by the narrowing walls, as if it had crept there and had died in the darkness, unable to withdraw or go forward. White spiders, demon-headed and large as monkeys, had woven their webs in the hollow arches of the bones; and they swarmed out interminably as Nushain approached; and the skeleton seemed to stir and quiver as they seethed over it abhorrently and dropped to the ground before the astrologer. Behind them others poured in a countless army, crowding and mantling every ossicle.]
